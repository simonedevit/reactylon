Welcome to **Reactylon**, a powerful multiplatform framework built on top of Babylon.js and React, designed to create interactive and immersive XR experiences. It allows developers to create full immersive experience in a declarative way, unlocking the full potential of React’s component-based architecture for interactive 3D applications.

## Key Features
- **Declarative Syntax for Babylon.js**: Write 3D scenes in JSX, leveraging the power of declarative UI that React developers love, with seamless integration into the Babylon.js rendering engine.

- **Full TypeScript support**: Leveraging Babylon.js classes, the appropriate props for each Babylon.js entity are generated and utilized within their corresponding React components.

- **Automatic Object Management**: No need to manually dispose of Babylon.js objects. Reactylon automatically handles the disposal of objects like meshes, cameras, and lights when their corresponding components are destroyed, ensuring efficient resource management and preventing memory leaks.

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Your applications can run not only on desktop and mobile browsers via PWAs, but also on VR/AR headsets. Thanks to Babylon Native and React Native integration, you can deploy your 3D applications natively to mobile devices and XR headsets with ease, expanding your audience reach across devices.

- **Scene Injection**: Scene management is simplified, with automatic injection of the Babylon.js scene object into every component. This reduces boilerplate and lets you focus on building rich 3D experiences.

- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Components are automatically added/removed to their correct parents, making it easier to build complex hierarchies of meshes, lights, and cameras without manually managing Babylon.js’s scene graph.

- **Enhanced React Integration**: Deep React integration allows for easy state management, component composition, and hooks, ensuring a seamless development experience that leverages React’s full power in 3D rendering.
