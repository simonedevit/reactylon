     * React calls this method so that you can compare the previous and the next props, and decide whether you need to update the underlying instance or not.
     * If you don't need to update it, return null. If you need to update it, you can return an arbitrary object representing the changes that need to happen.
     * Then in commitUpdate you would need to apply those changes to the instance.
     * This method happens in the render phase. It should only calculate the update â€” but not apply it! For example, the DOM renderer returns an array that looks
     * like [prop1, value1, prop2, value2, ...] for all props that have actually changed. And only in commitUpdate it applies those changes. You should calculate
     * as much as you can in prepareUpdate so that commitUpdate can be very fast and straightforward.
